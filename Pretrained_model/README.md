[The pre-trained model](https://zenodo.org/records/12747829) was published in our previous study, and it was trained using publicly available unlabeled pure sequence protein sequences from UniProt. <br><br>
Therefore, we can directly fine-tune this pre-trained model to construct the desired prediction model.
